Write a program that does the following: 
Calculate the sum of 1000000 integer random numbers, 
which can take value only as +2 or -2: 
call the sum as a1 and store in an array summ_r(1). 
Use a do loop and calculate this sum of 10000 times using a different seed each time. 
ore the value of each sum in summ_r(1),  
summ_r(2),  summ_r(3)........   summ_r(10000). 
The array summ_r of course has 10000 as size, it can store 10000 entries. 
Plot a histogram using the values obtained and stored in summ_r 
(Which means: count how many times the value of the sum lies between -10000 to -9990, 
-9990 to -9980 ... -10 to 0, 
between 0-10, between 10-20, between 20-30, ...... 9990 and 10000).
