Syntax is like below (no condition needed unlike other languages)
DO
    repeatative code-block
END DO

alternative of `break` statement in FORTRAN :
EXIT


alternative to `for` loop in FORTRAN :
DO var=start, stop, increment
    repeatative code-block
END DO

start, stop, increment are all INTEGERS
not boolean or conditions
